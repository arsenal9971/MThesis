\chapter{Code for inpainting sparse EPIs}
\label{sec:AppendixC}

The following code was used to inpaint the sparse EPIs with iterative hard thresholding as minimization algorithm and $0$-Shearlets as sparsifying syste; it was implemented using Julia programming language with the libraries PyPlot.jl and Shearlab.jl
